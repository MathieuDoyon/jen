# Project-level scripts directory

This directory holds scripts that specific to this project instance. 

These scripts will only be accessible from this project. They also have precedence over those at template- and root-level.

Note that, as these scripts are version-controlled along with the project itself, they can be edited independently from other projects. If you want to standardize, reuse and centralize scripts, you should rather place them into the root- or template-level `bin` directories.
